       <div class="about-content">
        Dr. J. Brian Tucker is from Kentucky, but spent most of his life in between southeast Michigan and Ohio. He met his wife, Amber, while studying at Lee University. They were married in 1988 and now have four daughters, Ashley, Alexandria, Annaliese and Abigail. He received his Bachelors of Science from Lee College, his Masters from Liberty University, his M. Div. from Michigan Theological Seminary, his D.Min. from Michigan Theological Seminary, and his Ph.D. from the University of Wales, Lampeter. <br><br>

        Starting out his career as a youth pastor in Ohio, Dr. Tucker had many stops along his journey. From leading various evangelical churches from the pulpit, he also dedicated his musical talents to the church in the form of a worship pastor. Eventually, he made the career transition into teaching, so he could have a greater impact in the lives of those he spoke to. “When you're a pastor, you're communicating information that gets them through the week. When you're a teacher, you're communicating information that gets them through their life.”<br><br> 

        Some of Dr. Tucker’s favorite things include European League soccer, science fiction television, especially Doctor Who, and both playing and listening to jazz music.<br><br>

        His primary studies have been on social identity and how it relates to our relationship with Christ. Recent works of his include publishing <span class="book-title-copy">The T&T Clark Handbook to Social Identity in the New Testament</span>. His current role at Moody Theological Seminary is the program head for the Master of Divinity, as well as the Professor of New Testament. He is an active member of many groups, including: Honorary Research Fellow, University of Wales, Trinity Saint David, Society of Biblical Literature, Chicago Society of Biblical Research, Institute for Biblical Research, and Evangelical Theological Society.
